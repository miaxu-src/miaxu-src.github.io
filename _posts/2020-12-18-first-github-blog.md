Welcome to my GitHub Pages! This website is built up with the help of Jekyll, a static site generator. As my first blog, here I'm providing a brief summary of steps that I followed to setup this site using Jekyll.

First thing first: Installation. This is my first time to play with Jekyll, but luckily Jekyll has very detailed installation info at <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">their website</a>.

Once Jekyll is installed, the easiest way to build up a site is to run the command `jekyll new my-website`. It will generate a nice template. To view how the site looks like, `bundle exec jekyll serve` will do the job. However, I perfer `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` instead. By adding `--watch`, Jekyll will auto rebuild the site every time I save my changes (except changes in the file `_config.yml`, which is a config file of Jekyll).

Although the generated template is nice enough, I found this <a href="">Step by Step Tutorial</a> is very helpful because I want to customize this website based on my own preference.

So far I have followed all the steps mentioned in the tutorial except the step 9. I will add more features such as grouping my blogs by tags, so stay tuned...
